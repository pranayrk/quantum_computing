*source: online*

* **Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, Michael A. Nielsen and Isaac L. Chuang, Cambridge University Press, 2002** The canonical reference for learning quantum computing, It's really complete. It has all the necesary prerrequisites (such as linear algebra, foundations of Quantum Mechanics, Shannon's formulation of Classical Information Theory, the basis of computer science and problem complexity, circuital approach to QC -rather than the more abstract Turing Machine formulation to QC-). It's an excellent book, though a little overwhelming if you never studied QM before.
* **Principles Of Quantum Computation And Information by Giuliano Benenti, Giuliano Strini, Giulio Casati** This is a more beginner-friendly version, compared to Nielsen's book, but it also covers in depth many experimental applications and quantum information theory aspects rather than QC in particular
* **An Introduction to Quantum. Computing, Phillip Kaye, Raymond Laflamme, and Michele Mosca. Oxford U. Press, New York, 20072. An Introduction to Quantum. Computing, Phillip Kaye, Raymond Laflamme, and Michele Mosca. Oxford U. Press, New York, 2007** his is an excellent book for QC. It explains in detail all of the fundamental QC problems (Deutsch-Jozsa, Simon, Grover, QFT-based algorithms and Shor's algorithm as well as many of the more theoretical problems such as the abelian stabilizer problem or the Solovay–Kitaev theorem with the appropiate Group Theory background being laid out).
* **Quantum Computer Science, N. David Mermin, Cambridge University Press 2007**
* **Dancing with Qubits by Robert Sutor**
* **Quantum Computing Since Democritus** talks about popular science
* **Introduction to Classical and Quantum Computing by Thomas Wong**  a super introduction book that explains basic Classical computing to Quantum computing.
* **Quantum Computing: An Applied Approach -Springer (2021) by Hidary, Jack D.** talks about the foundation and tools you need for QC.
* **Classical and Quantum Computation by Kitaev, Shen and Vyalyi** "little yellow book experience"
