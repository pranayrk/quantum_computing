## Other Recommended Books
* **Principles Of Quantum Computation And Information by Giuliano Benenti, Giuliano Strini, Giulio Casati** This is a more beginner-friendly version, compared to Nielsen's book, but it also covers in depth many experimental applications and quantum information theory aspects rather than QC in particular
* **An Introduction to Quantum. Computing, Phillip Kaye, Raymond Laflamme, and Michele Mosca. Oxford U. Press, New York, 20072. An Introduction to Quantum. Computing, Phillip Kaye, Raymond Laflamme, and Michele Mosca. Oxford U. Press, New York, 2007** his is an excellent book for QC. It explains in detail all of the fundamental QC problems (Deutsch-Jozsa, Simon, Grover, QFT-based algorithms and Shor's algorithm as well as many of the more theoretical problems such as the abelian stabilizer problem or the Solovayâ€“Kitaev theorem with the appropiate Group Theory background being laid out).
* **Quantum Computer Science, N. David Mermin, Cambridge University Press 2007**
* **Introduction to Classical and Quantum Computing by Thomas Wong**  a super introduction book that explains basic Classical computing to Quantum computing.
* **Quantum Computing: An Applied Approach -Springer (2021) by Hidary, Jack D.** talks about the foundation and tools you need for QC.
* **Classical and Quantum Computation by Kitaev, Shen and Vyalyi** "little yellow book experience"

## Popular Science
* **Dancing with Qubits, Robert Sutor** [gdrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T9Iw5vR8IKcT21suxGx7q-K4Iy_x5Wyx/view?usp=drive_link)

## More Specialized Books
* **From Classical to Quantum Shannon Theory, Mark Wilde** Thorough and detailed with plenty of exercises
* **The Functional Analysis of Quantum Information Theory written by Gupta, Mandayam and Sunder based on lectures by Effros, Paulsen, Pisier and Winter** Denser and focused on the math side more than applications.
* **Alice and Bob meet Banach by Aubrun and Szarek** Incomplete textbook draft, but it looks like it'll be the definitive treatment of the probabilistic method in quantum information.
* **The Mathematics of Entanglement by Brandao, Christandl, Walter and myself** Idiosyncratic and incomplete lecture notes on some of our pet topics.
