### Running and Testing

* [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/), IBMs quantum computing python package
* [Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq/tutorials) Google's version
* [IBM Quantum](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/) basically is like a Jupyter notebook, so a python environment, so you can just use Qiskit there without the need to install anything. But it also as two additional advantages. One: you can run your code (if it doesn't involve too many qubits) on a real quantum computer for free
* [Xanadu Quantum Codebook](https://codebook.xanadu.ai/) by Catalina Albornoz, Guillermo Alonso, Mikhail Andrenkov, and more. it is a fantastic codebook that gives you a good basic understanding of quantum computing, you should go over it before going for more exercise or content, if you get stuck hard check the walkthrough from [Owen Lockwood](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL91jA61XuCIB-4giBW3Hs-We1FE-fUxPV).
* [IBM Quantum Challenge](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aqiskit-community+quantum+challenge&type=repositories) by the qiskit community, each year has a different topic, where you can learn more about quantum computing, if you need help, go to qiskit slack, each challenge has different channels, where you can search for previous hints or questions asked.
* [QOSF Monthly Challenges](https://github.com/qosf/monthly-challenges) by qosf contributor, contains a lot of challenges and interesting topics in quantum computing.
* [Quantum Katas by Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/tutorial-qdk-intro-to-katas) is an open-source project developed by Microsoft that provides a set of self-paced programming exercises and tutorials for learning quantum computing
* [Quantum Computing Playground](https://www.quantumplayground.net/#/home) The Quantum Computing Playground is a browser-based interactive online platform that allows users to simulate and experiment with quantum circuits fun and engagingly
