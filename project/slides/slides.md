## Presentation Slides

* Quantum Computing Title
* Quantum Computing Introduction
* Quantum Computing Timeline 1: 
    * Main Image: Timeline
    * Early 1980s: Charles Bennett, Feynman, etc
* Quantum Computing Timeline 2:
    * Main Image: Timeline
    * Early 1990s: Proof that quantum computer could be faster, Shor's Algorithm, Grover's Algorithm
* Key facts from Quantum Mechanics
    * Photons have polarization a v1 + b v2 where a and b are complex numbers
    * Measuring a state changes it to one of the preferred bases with a certain probability
* Introduction to Qubits
    * Two state systems, which could be from photon polarization, electron spin, and the ground state together with an excited state of an atom.
* A concrete realization of a Qubit through polarizing filters
* Introduction to the Braket Notation
