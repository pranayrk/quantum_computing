"Peter Shor, ... polynomial-time quantum algorithm for factoring integers. This result provided a solution to a well-studied problem of practical interest. ... It is unknown whether an efficient classical solution exists, so Shor’s result does not prove that quantum computers can solve a problem more efficiently than a classical computer."

"Properties of quantum mechanics, such as the impossibility of reliably copying an unknown quantum state, made it look unlikely that effective error-correction techniques for quantum computation could ever be found. ... (However in) 1996 Shor and Robert Calderbank, and independently Andrew Steane, saw a way to finesse the seemingly show-stopping problems of quantum mechanics to develop quantum error correction techniques. Today, quantum error correction is arguably the most mature area of quantum information processing."

"In general, the set of all possible states of a physical system is called the state space of the system. Any quantum mechanical system that can be modeled by a two-dimensional complex vector space can be viewed as a qubit. ... Such systems, called two-state quantum systems, include photon polarization, electron spin, and the ground state together with an excited state of an atom. The two-state label for these systems does not mean that the state space has only two states—it has infinitely many—but rather that all possible states can be represented as a linear combination, or superposition, of just two states. For a two-dimensional complex vector space to be viewed as a qubit, two linearly independent states, labeled 0 and 1, must be distinguished."

"Quantum theory postulates that any device that measures a two-state quantum system must have two preferred states whose representative vectors, {u, u⊥}, form an orthonormal basis for the associated vector space. Measurement of a state transforms the state into one of the measuring device’s associated basis vectors u or u⊥. The probability that the state is measured as basis vector u is the square of the magnitude of the amplitude of the component of the state in the direction of the basis vector u. For example, given a device for measuring the polarization of photons with associated basis {u, u⊥}, the state v = au + bu⊥ is measured as u with probability a squared and as u⊥ with probability b squared ... For this reason, whenever anyone says “measure a qubit," they must specify with respect to which basis the measurement takes place."
