Quantum computing represents a revolutionary paradigm in information processing, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations that were once thought to be impossible for classical computers. This report highlights the mathematical foundations of quantum computing and explores the key concepts that distinguish it from classical computation.

The report begins with an overview of the quantum bit, or qubit, and its unique property of superposition, allowing quantum computers to exist in multiple states simultaneously. The framework is then expanded using the quantum specific properties of entanglement and measurement. Further, it develops understanding of the unitary transformations that govern quantum dynamics.

The report concludes with a brief discussion of some applications of quantum computing. These are Quantum teleportation protocol and Grover's algorthm, which were chosen since they adequately highlight the non-intuitive character of quantum computing.
