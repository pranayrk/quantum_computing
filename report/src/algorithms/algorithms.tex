To include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Quantum Algorithms can be abstracted as circuits, and these circuits can be represented as a product of matrices
\item For any classical circuit, there exists a quantum circuit that performs the computation with similar efficiency
\item 
\end{itemize}

A circuit model for quantum computing describes all computations in terms of a circuit composed of simple gates followed by a sequence of measurements.

The standard circuit model for quantum computation uses gates from { CNOT gate together with all single qubit transformations} and its measurements as all single qubit measurements in the standard basis, i.e. all computations in the standard basis consist of a sequence of gates that are either CNOT or single-qubit gates followed by a sequence of single-qubit measurements.
